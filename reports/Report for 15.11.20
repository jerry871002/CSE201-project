Arthur : 

Last week I worked on familiarising myself with unreal engine by watching tutorials and videos. 
We had to change our game engine to godot so after that I worked on familiarising myself on Godot. 
for next week, we are going to discuss tommorow the exact individual work but I will work more precisely on trying to implement a 2D user friendly interface.
