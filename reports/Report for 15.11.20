Arthur : 

Last week I worked on familiarising myself with unreal engine by watching tutorials and videos. 
We had to change our game engine to godot so after that I worked on familiarising myself on Godot. 
for next week, we are going to discuss tommorow the exact individual work but I will work more precisely on trying to implement a 2D user friendly interface.


Antoine:
This week I worked on better understanding unreal engine, and now instead familiarising with Godot.
More importantly with the object team we designed our basic inheritance tree for our main objects in our world. 
I did this though a prezi presentation, which we then changed to using the Lucid app, building our inheritance tree there. 
For next week I want to understand how Godot works and enter in more detail the structure of our inheritance objects. 

Saga:
Last week, I worked on a class map with the objects team, so as to visualize the classes that we were going to need for our project, especially the attributes they would have and the inheritance.
I also tried to understand and download unreal engine until we decided to switch to Godot, so I watched tutorials on how to work on Godot.
Finally I started writing the classes, but next week I will need to separate each one of them in different files, so that our game can work on Godot. 
So, next week I will continue working on the objects classes.
