Saga:
This week i wrote functions to compute the probability that solar panels, wind turbines and double glazing are added on houses.
For that I had to reorganize the code for the housing class. The next few days I will fix some of the things that aren't working perfectly.

Anna:
This week I finished wheat section in agriculrural production class and wrote how pesticide/fertilizer prohibition law policies modify some properties of wheat.
Also I wrote a function in city which for each type of transport calculates probability that it will be added basing it on a model Eliott had written before in python. 
Next week I am planning to work on transport policies.

Samuel:
This week I included the functions of edit_text_files.cpp in the main loop of the game. I ran into several problems regarding these functions.
Mainly because of two issues: the differences in the godot string and the c++ string, and a problem in which godot cannot write into files,
because of libraries issues. This last problem is still unsolved for now and I will be working on this the coming week. Moreover, I managed to
retrieve all the attributes of the different buildings this week and am now defining our counters and indices based on this. I plan to finish
this the coming week.
