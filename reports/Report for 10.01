Saga:
This weel i wrote functions to compute the probability that solar panels, wind turbines and double glazing are added on houses.
For that I had to reorganize the code for the housing class. The next few days I will fix some of the things that aren't working perfectly.

This week I finished wheat section in agriculrural production class and wrote how pesticide/fertilizer prohibition law policies modify some properties of wheat.
Also I wrote a function in city which for each type of transport calculates probability that it will be added basing it on a model Eliott had written before in python. 
Next week I am planning to work on transport policies.

Luca:
This week and during the holidays, I finished fixing the bugs for plotting pie charts and line charts in Godot. Now, they are working perfectly. Moreover, I have worked with the algorithm team so as to make my charts functional. 
In the next few days, I will continue to work with the algorithm team so as to display relevant data about the city with my charts.
