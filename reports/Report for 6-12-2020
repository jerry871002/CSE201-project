Saga:
This week I learnt how to compile on Mac with the help of my teammates. I fixed some errors in my code and continued working on the housing classes.
I now have code for each of the classes I was working on and next week I will see if I need to add things, and then maybe move on to another class.

This week I focus on designing a unit test process for object and algorithm to test our code. There's a document describing the whole process in the doc/ folder,
which include how to write, compile and execute testing program on the target. Next week I will working on the counting system of indices in the City class and also
let the Car and Transport class work together.
