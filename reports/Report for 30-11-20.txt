Yury:
This week I have implemented the update function of the City object, which will allow to recompute all the structures and counters at time t+1.
For the week the goal is to create a running simulation with one "restaurant" object in it and to standardize all the variable names. 

Jerry:
This week I figure out how to implement time mechanism using the built-in function of Godot. Also I work with the algo team to fix some bugs in our city object, 
design the algorithm of calculating the indices of our city by iterating all the buildings in our city.
Next week I will keep working on the algorithm and also try to design the algorithm behind the newly add car object.

Anna:
This week I worked on modelling and implementing car and bus classes. Next week i am planning to work on other types of classes.  

Saga:
This week, I wrote the code for the lowhouse and highhouse classes, and gathered information on buildings.
next week i will implement the code for buildings, and start working on another class.

Vincent : 
This week the simulation team mainly worked on writing a City class, which contains all the crucial elements in our game. 
We worked on creating a mechanism independent from Godot for progressing time and fixed several bugs that we found in the code. 
I created a return_game_date() function which gives the time in our program, and managed to create functioning a main loop which creates a city instance and runs outside of the Godot engine, which should allow us to debug the simulation without actually opening the game itself.
Next week we will want to implement all features necessary in the city class to be able to add buildings of any class to the city and keep track of changes in their attributes.
