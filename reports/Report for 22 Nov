Saga:
This week I worked on making a different file for each class of objects that are displayed on our world. 
Then, I did research on energy in houses and wrote some code for a Low Level House.
Next week, I will do research on the rest of the Housing subclasses (high level house and buildings) and write the corresponding code.

Anna:
This week I worked on creating separate files for different classes. 
Also I made some research about how buses work in real-life and different variables that influence the proccess and got ready for writing the code.
Next week I plan to do more research about different types of transport and implement some code.

Eliott:
This week I work with Ambroise to make object clickable, to display and remove physical attributes of building and created the mall asset.
Next week, I will implement the 2D menu in the 3D world (appearing when one clicks on the object).
