Saga:
This week I worked on making a different file for each class of objects that are displayed on our world. 
Then, I did research on energy in houses and wrote some code for a Low Level House.
Next week, I will do research on the rest of the Housing subclasses (high level house and buildings) and write the corresponding code.
