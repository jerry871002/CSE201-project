Paloma :
This week I restructured the objects' code together with Antoine and Eliott. I found the data and coded the variables we need for implementing solar panels and rooftop wind
turbines. I started working on the Services and Goods factories classes and created a document in which we are adding the policies which we are going to implement in the simulation.
I now need to finsih coding the Services and Factories classes, add randomness in the energy class which is otherwise done and help deciding and implementing policies with the 
simulation team.
