# Reports

This directory is for the weekly reports.

The requirement of the reports are quoted below:

**Each student** must prepare a (personal) project’s report every week. The weekly report helps you understanding what was your progress this week and forces you to plan ahead what to do in the next week. The report is quite important to communicate to us the status of the project (e.g., do you have a plan? Are you stuck on the same task or are you progressing according to the plan?). The report further helps us understanding who is doing what and have an idea about your contributions and commitment to the project (i.e., we will also use the report for evaluation).

Each one of you should compose a short paragraph (ideally a couple of sentences) describing:

* What you did in the past week (e.g., the list of tasks that you completed or that got some progress).

* What do you plan to work on in the next week (your plan may change after your team meeting on Monday).

For example, a individual project report could be:

```
This week I implemented the rendering of the game weapons.
Next week I will design and implement the classes rendering the enemies of the game.
```

Every task in the report should appear in your Trello board and every implemented feature should correspond to one or more commits on GitHub. Make sure your commit messages on git refer back to the task description they implement (e.g., a commit message like `Render the game weapons` is informative while a commit message like `new code` is not).

**IMPORTANT:** You will produce **a single report** per team and upload it in your git repository **by Sunday night** (remember to push that on GitHub). Create a folder named `reports` in your git repository and create a new report for each project’s week (a simple text file is sufficient).
