Arthur : This week I finished my menu and fixed its bugs. I implemented the time and started working with luca to make 
the graphs functional in the menu. 

Anna:
This week I finished implementing transport class and implemented all types of transport, and I also started implemeting healthcare class (even though i still did not commit my changings)
and researching about hospitals in real world. Next week I plan to continue working on healthcare and other objects with the team.

Paloma: This week I did research on additional energy sources which we can implement as policies and finished coding the geothermal power plant class. Next week with the objects 
team we are going to have to modify in part the structure of our classes due to a Godot inheritance problem that is being fixed. I will also continue coding the energy sector to
finish with one or two more classes only.
