Arthur : This week I finished my menu and fixed its bugs. I implemented the time and started working with luca to make 
the graphs functional in the menu. 

Anna:
This week I finished implementing transport class and implemented all types of transport, and I also started implemeting healthcare class (even though i still did not commit my changings)
and researching about hospitals in real world. Next week I plan to continue working on healthcare and other objects with the team.

Saga:
This week I started working on agricultural production and services classes. 
Next week I will need to make some changes in the housing classes because we have discussed some changes in the way we write our functions with the objects team.
I will also continue working on the two new classes I started this week.
