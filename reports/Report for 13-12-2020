Arthur:
This week I finished my menu and fixed its bugs. I implemented the time and started working with Luca to make the graphs functional in the menu. 

Anna:
This week I finished implementing transport class and implemented all types of transport, and I also started implementing healthcare class (even though i still did not commit my changings)
and researching about hospitals in real world. Next week I plan to continue working on healthcare and other objects with the team.

Saga:
This week I started working on agricultural production and services classes. 
Next week I will need to make some changes in the housing classes because we have discussed some changes in the way we write our functions with the objects team.
I will also continue working on the two new classes I started this week.

Jerry:
This week I tried to understand how Car and Transport class interact with each other and affect the indices of the city. 
Next week I will work on actually implement the algorithm. Calculate all the indices we need to display in the game.

Luca:
This week, I coded some more functions that edit csv files. I explained to the algorithm team how they can use my work to store some data of the city. I added comments in my cpp files in order to explain how my functions work. I also began to code a 2D menu so as to display my charts that I managed to plot a week ago. This week, I plan to continue to work on my 2D menu.
